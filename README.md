# Initialize Github Actions CI/CD Pipeline for Terraform

# This repository contains infrastructure code managed with Terraform, with a CI/CD pipeline set up using GitHub Actions to automate the testing and deployment processes

# Description
The project aims to initialize a Github Actions CI/CD pipeline for Terraform to ensure infrastructure changes can be automated, securely executed, and controlled through manual approvals and branch restrictions. The codes in this project shows how to achieve the following.

* creation of Github Actions workflow which is committed to the repository
* Workflow configuration to trigger on push and pull request events
* Utilizing Github Secrets to securely store AWS credentials and other sensitive information.
* A manual approval step is implemented in the workflow before applying changes to production.
* The workflow ensures that terraform apply can only be executed on the main branch for production environments

# The workflow includes steps to :
    Initialize Terraform
    Validate Terraform configurations
    The workflow plans and applies Terraform changes to the "sandbox" environment when working on feature branches
    For other environments, the workflow only plans changes on feature branches but doesn't apply them

# How to trigger the pipeline
* Via GitHub Actions Interface:

    Go to the repository on GitHub.
    Click on the "Actions" tab.
    Select the workflow you want to run (e.g., ".github/workflows").
    Click the "Run workflow" button and select the branch to run the workflow on.

* Via GitHub CLI

    Install the GitHub CLI if you haven't already.
    Use the following command to trigger the workflow:
    gh workflow run <.github/workflow> --ref <branch>


# Managing the Pipeline

* Monitoring Pipeline Status
    Navigate to the "Actions" tab in the repository
    You can see the status of recent workflow runs (success, failure, in progress).
    Use the GitHub CLI to check the status of workflow runs with the command 'gh run list'

* Viewing Logs
    In the GitHub Actions interface, click on a specific workflow run to view detailed logs for each step of the pipeline

* Restarting Failed Jobs
    Navigate to the failed job.
    Click on the "Re-run jobs" button
    You can also use the following command: gh run rerun <run_id>

# Slack Notification Setup

* Create a [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps) for your workspace (alternatively use an existing app you have already created and installed).
* Add the [incoming-webhook](https://api.slack.com/scopes/incoming-webhook) bot scope under OAuth & Permissions.
* Install the app to your workspace (you will select a channel to notify)
* Activate and create a new webhook under Incoming Webhooks.
* Copy the Webhook URL from the Webhook you just generated [add it as a secret in your repo settings](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) named SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL.

# How to use tfvars Files for Different Environments in Terraform

* Create tfvars files for each environment e.g sandbox.tfvars, staging.tfvars etc and add the variables as shown below

sandbox.tfvars
```
environment   = "sandbox"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
region        = "us-west-2"

```

staging.tfvars

```
environment   = "staging"
instance_type = "t2.medium"
region        = "us-east-1"

```
* Reference the variables In in the Terraform configuration files (e.g., main.tf)
* Initialize Terraform in the project directory then preview the changes Terraform will make by using the plan command with the appropriate tfvars file.
```
terraform plan -var-file="sandbox.tfvars"
```
* Then apply the configuration for the specific environment by specifing the appropriate tfvars file for the environment.
```
terraform apply --auto-approve -var-file="sandbox.tfvars"
```


# EC2 Module Documentation
### Overview
The EC2 module can now support both standalone EC2 instances and Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs). This flexibility allows you to deploy either a single EC2 instance or a group of instances that can scale automatically based on demand.

### Variables
- **use_asg:** Boolean flag to toggle between standalone EC2 instances and Auto Scaling Groups.
- **instance_count:** Number of EC2 instances to create (only applicable when use_asg is false).
- **instance_type:** The type of instance to start (e.g., t2.micro).
- **key_name:** Key pair name to access the EC2 instances.
- **subnet_ids:** List of subnet IDs where instances or ASG will be deployed.
- **vpc_security_groups:** List of security group IDs to associate with the instances or ASG.
- **ami_name_filter:** Filter to select the AMI by name.
- **ami_owner:** The owner of the AMI.
- **desired_capacity:** Desired number of instances in the ASG (only applicable when use_asg is true).
- **min_size:** Minimum size of the ASG (only applicable when use_asg is true).
- **max_size:** Maximum size of the ASG (only applicable when use_asg is true).
- **pod:** Pod name for tagging.
- **root_volume_size:** Size of the root volume in GiB.
- **root_volume_type:** Type of the root volume (e.g., gp2 or gp3).
- **environment:** Environment name for tagging.
- **tags:** Additional tags to associate with the instances or ASG.

Conclusion
The above Terraform module and examples demonstrate how to use the use_asg variable to toggle between standalone EC2 instances and Auto Scaling Groups. By following the provided examples, you can easily deploy either a single EC2 instance or an ASG in your AWS environment. This flexibility allows for scalable and resilient infrastructure that can adapt to varying workloads.

# TFSec Integration for terraform

[*tfsec*](https://aquasecurity.github.io/tfsec/v0.63.1/) is a static analysis security scanner for your Terraform code. Designed to run locally and in your CI pipelines, developer-friendly output and fully documented checks mean detection and remediation can take place as quickly and efficiently as possible.
### TFSec Scan Results Interpretation
TFSec generates scan results in JSON format, categorizing issues by severity levels: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW. Each result includes:
#### Issue Description:
Details on the security issue or best practice violation detected. Severity Level: Indicates the criticality of the issue. Location: Specifies the file and line number where the issue was found.
### Interpreting Severity Levels
CRITICAL and HIGH: These issues pose significant security risks and should be addressed immediately. MEDIUM and LOW: While less critical, these issues should still be reviewed and resolved to maintain best practices and security hygiene.
### Ignoring Warnings
You may wish to ignore some warnings. If you'd like to do so, you can simply add a comment containing tfsec:ignore: to the offending line in your templates. If the problem refers to a block of code, such as a multiline string, you can add the comment on the line above the block, by itself.
For example, to ignore an open security group rule:
```
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "my-rule" {
    type = "ingress"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] #tfsec:ignore:aws-vpc-no-public-ingress-sgr
}
```
...or...
```
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "my-rule" {
    type = "ingress"
    #tfsec:ignore:aws-vpc-no-public-ingress-sgr
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}
```

# Documentation: Setting Up and Configuring the Terraform Backend with S3 and DynamoDB

## Overview

This documentation provides instructions on setting up and configuring the Terraform backend using Amazon S3 for state file storage and DynamoDB for state locking. It also includes guidelines for managing and troubleshooting backend configuration issues.

### Prerequisites

. AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate credentials
. Terraform installed
. AWS account with permissions to create and manage S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, and IAM roles/policies

### Backend Configuration Steps
1. Create an S3 Bucket for State Files
Create the S3 bucket:
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-terraform-state-bucket --region us-east-1 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-east-1

2. Enable versioning on the S3 bucket:
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket my-terraform-state-bucket --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled

3. Create lifecycle policy to manage state file versions:
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "ID": "retain-state-files",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Prefix": "",
      "NoncurrentVersionExpiration": {
        "NoncurrentDays": 30
      }
    }
  ]
}
###Â Save this as lifecycle.json and apply it:
aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket my-terraform-state-bucket --lifecycle-configuration file://lifecycle.json

2. Create a DynamoDB Table for State Locking
Create the DynamoDB table:

aws dynamodb create-table --table-name my-terraform-state-lock --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=1,WriteCapacityUnits=1

3. Configure IAM Roles and Policies
1. Create an IAM user:
aws iam create-user --user-name terraform

2. Attach S3 and DynamoDB policies to the IAM user:
. Create a policy file s3_policy.json for S3 access:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-terraform-state-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-terraform-state-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

. Create a policy file dynamodb_policy.json for DynamoDB access:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "dynamodb:PutItem",
        "dynamodb:GetItem",
        "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
        "dynamodb:DescribeTable",
        "dynamodb:Scan"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/my-terraform-state-lock"
    }
  ]
}

. Attach the policies:

aws iam put-user-policy --user-name terraform --policy-name terraform-s3-policy --policy-document file://s3_policy.json
aws iam put-user-policy --user-name terraform --policy-name terraform-dynamodb-policy --policy-document file://dynamodb_policy.json


4. Configure Terraform Backend
1. Define backend configuration in main.tf:

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "my-terraform-state-lock"
  }
}

2. Initialize the backend:
terraform init

Managing and Troubleshooting Backend Configuration
Common Issues
1. Access Denied Errors:

. Ensure the IAM user has the correct permissions for S3 and DynamoDB.
. Verify that the IAM policies are correctly attached.

2. State Locking Issues:

. DynamoDB table must exist and be properly configured.
. Ensure the DynamoDB table's read/write capacity is sufficient.

3. Incorrect Bucket or Table Names:

. Double-check the bucket name and table name in the Terraform configuration.

Steps to Debug

1. Check IAM Policies:

. Ensure the IAM user has the correct policies attached using the AWS Management Console or CLI.

2. Verify S3 Bucket and DynamoDB Table:

. Use AWS CLI or Management Console to verify that the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table exist and are configured correctly.

3. Enable Detailed Logging:

. Enable detailed logging for S3 and DynamoDB to capture more information about the requests and responses.

4. Terraform Debug Mode:

. Run Terraform with detailed logging to capture more information about the backend configuration process:
TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform init

### Summary
This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to setting up and configuring the Terraform backend with S3 and DynamoDB. It also includes tips for managing and troubleshooting common issues with backend configuration. Ensure that you have the necessary AWS permissions and that your Terraform configuration correctly references the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table.



# AWS Transit Gateway

A [transit gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-transit-gateways.html) enables you to attach VPCs and VPN connections and route traffic between them. In simpler terms, AWS Transit Gateway is like a central hub that connects your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks. It simplifies your network and eliminates complicated peering relationships. It functions as a cloud router, establishing new connections only once.

The VPC module can now support the the provision of a transit gateway and connects the VPC to it. Adding a Transit Gateway to a VPC module in Terraform involves several steps

### Step 1:
* You need to define the Transit Gateway resource in your Terraform configuration add the following code to the main.tf for VPC module or you can create a new file e.g. transit_gateway.tf in the VPC module:
```
resource "aws_ec2_transit_gateway" "transit_gateway" {
  description = "Example Transit Gateway"
  amazon_side_asn = 64512

  tags = {
    Name = "example-transit-gateway"
  }
}
```

### Step 2:
* Attach the Transit Gateway to your VPC. Assuming your VPC module outputs the VPC ID and has subnets defined, you can create a Transit Gateway attachment with the the following code below in the transit-gateway.tf file

```
resource "aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment" "transit_gateway_attachment" {
  transit_gateway_id = aws_ec2_transit_gateway.transit_gateway.id
  vpc_id             = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_ids         = module.vpc.public_subnets

  tags = {
    Name = "example-transit-gateway-attachment"
  }
}
```

### Step 3:
â¢Â Create a Route table for the transit Gateway
```
resource "aws_route_table" "transit-gateway-route-table" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
}
```

### Step 4:
â¢Â Create the Route for the Transit Gateway

```
resource "aws_route" "transit_gateway_route" {
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.transit-gateway-route-table.id
  destination_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
  transit_gateway_id = aws_ec2_transit_gateway.transit_gateway.id

}
```
With this setup, you can create a Transit Gateway, attach it to your VPC, and update the routing tables to use the Transit Gateway for outbound traffic. 

```
Documentation
Network Load Balancer (NLB) Provisioning and Configuration
This documentation provides detailed steps on how to provision and configure a Network Load Balancer (NLB) using Terraform modules. This NLB can be integrated with listeners and Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) in subsequent tasks.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Terraform installed on your local machine.
AWS credentials configured on your local machine.
An existing VPC where the NLB will be deployed.
Subnets (preferably in multiple availability zones) for the NLB.
NLB Provisioning
Define the NLB Module Configuration

In your main.tf file, define the module for provisioning the NLB. This example assumes you have a Terraform module defined for NLB at ./modules/nlb.

hcl
Copy code
module "nlb" {
  source                  = "./modules/nlb"
  nlb_name                = var.nlb_name
  internal                = var.internal
  subnets                 = module.vpc.public_subnet_ids
  vpc_id                  = module.vpc.vpc_id
  tags                    = merge(var.tags, { Name = "nlb" })
  enable_deletion_protection = false
}
Variables Definition

Ensure you have the necessary variables defined in your variables.tf file or as part of your module:

hcl
Copy code
variable "nlb_name" {
  description = "The name of the Network Load Balancer"
  type        = string
}

variable "internal" {
  description = "Whether the NLB is internal"
  type        = bool
  default     = false
}

variable "subnets" {
  description = "A list of subnet IDs for the NLB"
  type        = list(string)
}

variable "vpc_id" {
  description = "The ID of the VPC"
  type        = string
}

variable "tags" {
  description = "A map of tags to assign to the resources"
  type        = map(string)
}
Output Definition

Capture the output values for the NLB to use in other parts of your infrastructure. Add the following to your outputs.tf file:

hcl
Copy code
output "nlb_arn" {
  description = "The ARN of the NLB"
  value       = module.nlb.nlb_arn
}

output "nlb_dns_name" {
  description = "The DNS name of the NLB"
  value       = module.nlb.nlb_dns_name
}
NLB Module Implementation
Ensure the ./modules/nlb module is implemented correctly. Below is an example of what the main.tf in the NLB module might look like:

hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_lb" "nlb" {
  name               = var.nlb_name
  internal           = var.internal
  load_balancer_type = "network"
  subnets            = var.subnets
  enable_deletion_protection = var.enable_deletion_protection

  tags = var.tags
}

output "nlb_arn" {
  description = "The ARN of the NLB"
  value       = aws_lb.nlb.arn
}

output "nlb_dns_name" {
  description = "The DNS name of the NLB"
  value       = aws_lb.nlb.dns_name
}
```
